# WELCOME TO THE PRECOURSE PART 3!!!

Part 3 of the precourse is equipped with a JSON parser and exposure to a more complex web app, perhaps even a JS framework. We aspire you to be proficient in your JavaScript skills and become a better programmer through the process.

If this is challenging, don't be worried! Getting used to the challenge will be a great asset to you in our program.

## You (STILL) Need To Know How To Use GitHub!

Please refer to the **"How do I get started"** section in [Github.md](https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/precourse-part-1/blob/master/GitHub.md#how-do-i-get-started) from precourse-part-1 if you need a refresher on how to fork and clone your repo.

## Style guide

As always, we will push you here at Codesmith to continue following the [Airbnb styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), a comprehensive and opinionated styleguide for JavaScript. As you work the curriculum, try following the Airbnb styleguide as much as you can. The more you follow it, the more professional your code will look. 

## Instructions For The Precourse Challenges:

We divided part 3 of the precourse challenges into two sections: a [JSON parser](./json-parser) and an [Instagram clone](./instagram-clone). For the JSON parser challenge, you will be creating a JSON parser yourself, although it already exists as a JavaScript method. Please read the "README.md" files inside the two folders for further instructions about each challenge. Be creative with your project and show us that you want to have fun with programming.

**BONUS**
If you complete both the JSON parser and Instagram Clone, then we highly recommend getting introduced with some popular [front-end frameworks](./bonus-frameworks). Try to convert your Instagram Clone app into one that uses one of the two frameworks.

## What do I do when I am done?

Please refer to the **"What do I do when I am done with a unit?"** section in [Github.md](https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/precourse-JSFundamentals/blob/master/GitHub.md/#what-do-i-do-when-i-am-done-with-a-unit) from precourse-part-1 if you need a refresher on how to fork and clone your repo.
